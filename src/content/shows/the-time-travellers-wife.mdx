synopsis: "When Clare's search for inspiration leads her to discover Henry DeTamble at the library, she is overjoyed. Henry, however, is politely bemused by her enthusiasm. Clare has known Henry since she was six and is aware of his genetic disorder that causes him to time travel unpredictably. Separated by time and uncertainty, Henry and Clare fight to hold onto each other whilst everything threatens to pull them apart."

The Time Traveller's Wife premiered at Storyhouse in Chester from September 30 to October 15, 2022, before transferring to the Apollo Theatre in London's West End where it began previews on October 7, 2023 and officially opened on November 1, 2023. The production was produced by Colin Ingram for InTheatre Productions by special arrangement with Warner Bros. Theatre Ventures.

The West End cast featured David Hunter (Waitress, Kinky Boots) as Henry, Joanna Woodward (Pretty Woman The Musical) as Clare, Tim Mahendran (&Juliet) as Gomez, Hiba Elchikhe (Everybody's Talking About Jamie) as Charisse, and Ross Dawes (Disney's Newsies) as Henry's Dad.

The production featured innovative staging with projections, video work, and theatrical illusions to create the effect of Henry travelling through time. The standout production number "Journeyman" created the illusion of Henry racing through time itself using animations, choreography, puppeteers, and stage magic.

Kait Kerrigan contributed additional lyrics to the score by Grammy Award-winning artists Joss Stone and Dave Stewart (of Eurythmics fame). The musical was originally booking through March 30, 2024, but closed early on February 24, 2024.
