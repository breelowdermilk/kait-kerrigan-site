The Great Gatsby opened on Broadway at the Broadway Theatre on April 25, 2024, following a record-breaking, sold-out world premiere at Paper Mill Playhouse in October 2023. The production has made history as a global theatrical phenomenon, running simultaneously in three world capitals.

## Broadway Production

The original Broadway cast starred Tony nominees Jeremy Jordan as Jay Gatsby and Eva Noblezada as Daisy Buchanan, with Noah J. Ricketts as Nick Carraway, Samantha Pauly as Jordan Baker, and John Zdrojeski as Tom Buchanan. The production won the 2024 Tony Award for Best Costume Design of a Musical for Linda Cho's nearly 300 dazzling costumes that bring the glamour of the Jazz Age to life.

## West End Premiere

The musical made its European debut at London's prestigious Coliseum on April 24, 2025, starring Jamie Muscato as Gatsby, Frances Mayli McCann as Daisy, Corbin Bleu as Nick, and featuring West End stars including Jon Robyns, Rachel Tucker, and John Owen-Jones. The limited engagement runs through September 7, 2025.

## Seoul Production

In August 2025, The Great Gatsby became the first Broadway-originated production to run simultaneously in New York, London, and Seoul. Presented at GS Arts Center in English with Korean subtitles, the production stars Tony Award winner Matt Doyle as Gatsby, with original Broadway company members joining the cast. Korean producer Chunsoo Shin made history as the first Asian to serve as sole lead producer of a Broadway musical.

## A U.S. Tour

A national tour is scheduled to launch in Baltimore in February 2026.

## About the Adaptation

Kait Kerrigan's book carefully translates Fitzgerald's prose into dialogue and scenes that capture the essence of the story while flowing naturally in a theatrical setting. The production balances fidelity to the beloved source material with the demands of live theater, distilling the sprawling narrative into key scenes that honor the novel's exploration of the American Dream.
