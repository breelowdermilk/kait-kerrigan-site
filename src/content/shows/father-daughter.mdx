Father/Daughter is a recipient of the **Edgerton Foundation New Play Award**. The play asks a central question: What can we learn from the relationships we choose in order to repair the relationships we inherit?

In parallel stories told 23 years apart, Baldwin is Miranda's 30-year-old divorced father who is trying to forge a new relationship with a beguiling woman, and Miranda is Baldwin's 30-year-old daughter who has found herself in her first serious relationship. Two actors play both pairs of lovers, creating an unspoken but palpable link between the generations.

The world premiere production was presented by Aurora Theatre Company in Berkeley, California, running November 12 - December 12, 2021. Directed by M. Graham Smith, the production starred William Thomas Hodgson and Sam Jackson, with set design by Kate Boyd, costume design by Courtney Flores, lighting design by David K H Elliott, and sound design/original music by Cliff Caruthers.
