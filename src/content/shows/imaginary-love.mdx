Now in new relationships, Kara and Lyle are unable to let their vivid memories of childlike romance go. For the first time in their lives, they are forced—in both dreams and reality—to confront the question of what love is, and more, what purpose it serves. The play uses flashbacks and imaginative staging to show ex-lovers meeting in their minds and finishing each other's thoughts across the stage.
