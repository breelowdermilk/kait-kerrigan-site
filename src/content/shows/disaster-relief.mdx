In Disaster Relief, Jenny and Bank both run away from their past trauma but in polar opposite ways. Jenny tries to become a different person, but does not stray very far from home. Bank tries to outpace his pain by attending to the pain of others and never looking inward.

Neither functions in a sustainable way and they are constantly haunted by the trauma that they can't escape. They see echoes of each other and their assailant Mike in every person they meet no matter how much time and space distances them from their moment of original sin. Inevitably, or perhaps by design, they find each other again at what feels like the ends of the earth in the midst of another impending disaster. Face to face with each other for the first time in ten years, they wonder if together they might be able to find relief.

The play deals with repressed trauma, especially of the high school variety, and explores how we try to grow up. Drawing on psychological development research that argues we become the people we will be in high school, the play examines what happens when a person experiences the most extreme kind of danger and trauma during those formative years, and takes dangerous actions.
