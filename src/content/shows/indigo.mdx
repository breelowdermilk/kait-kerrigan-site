Indigo tells the story of three generations of women, their individual struggles and perspectives on the world, and explores how art and the senses can bring connection, particularly to people who see the world a little differently. Autistic non-verbal teenager Emma is mourning the loss of her father, and shows us her inner world where she experiences the world as a range of colours.

The musical sensitively explores themes of living with Alzheimer's, autism, and synesthesia, celebrating the bonds that unite a family.
