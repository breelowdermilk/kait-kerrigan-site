This contemporary musical explores the complex inner life of a young woman torn between safety and adventure, between her mother's expectations and her best friend's wild dreams. Will she follow in her mother's footsteps, or take the dare of her impetuous best friend and chart a new path?

The Mad Ones premiered off-Broadway at 59E59 Theaters in November 2017, followed by its UK premiere at the Other Palace in London in October 2024. The London production garnered critical acclaim for its intimate staging and powerful performances, with critics praising its ability to capture "the universal experience of standing at life's crossroads" and its "achingly beautiful score that speaks directly to the heart."
