Justice is an intimate, epic musical exploring the first women on the U.S. Supreme Court—Sandra Day O'Connor, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and Sonia Sotomayor—at the height of their power. The three justices confront and comfort each other about equal justice under the law, legal strategy, and civic responsibility, as well as husbands, motherhood, dreams, and sorrows, all while setting a new course for the country.

The world premiere was presented by Arizona Theatre Company in April 2022, followed by productions at Marin Theatre Company (2023) and Ensemble Theatre Company Santa Barbara. Available for licensing through [The Gersh Agency](mailto:licensing@gershny.com).
