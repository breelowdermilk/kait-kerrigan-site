book by Kait Kerrigan lyrics by Kait Kerrigan and Bree Lowdermilk music by Bree Lowdermilk Synopsis: When mousy grad student Helen Morton first moves to New York, she is overwhelmed by the noise. Even though she&rsquo;s moved to the city to write her dissertation on noise, its constant, loud, and overwhelming presence is more than she bargained for. It doesn&rsquo;t help that her downstairs neighbor is a violinist who plays at all hours, or that her landlady gets drunk and sits on their front stoop, talking loudly to anyone who&rsquo;ll listen. It also doesn&rsquo;t help that her dissertation advisor seems to be out to get her. Helen has never felt more beleaguered by people and sounds, and at the same time, she&rsquo;s never felt more alone in the world. The Woman Upstairs weaves university politics, neighbor relations, and coming of age into tapestry of 8 million people. But at the heart of it, it&rsquo;s simply an old-fashioned romance between a physicist and the sounds of the city she learns to love. Production/Development History: New York Musical Theater Festival North Shore Music Theatre Reviews: &ldquo;Sometimes, a musical comes along that announces itself from its first few notes as something very, very special&hellip; Overtones are being created, individual threads of music are weaving together to form a tapestry of emotion and sense of place that overcomes you like a wave crashing against the rocks. The sound is New York, and it&rsquo;s as familiar as the constant rush of the sound of the streets, but simultaneously invigorating and musically new.&rdquo; Talkin&rsquo; Broadway &ldquo;Jot down the name Bree Lowdermilk, the composer-lyricist who has written the astonishing score for The Woman Upstairs. Incorporating additional lyrics by director-librettist Kait Kerrigan, Lowdermilk has tossed out a cornucopia of melodies and counter-melodies that rocket him upward on the list of people who are pointing to exciting new directions for the book musical.&rdquo; Theater Mania &ldquo;This week&rsquo;s New York Musical Theater Festival seems like an open audition for an heir to the astoundingly successful Rent. The sweet music of Bree Lowdermilk&rsquo;s The Woman Upstairs &ndash; a tale of antagonistic Greenwich Village neighbors who find romance in close quarters &mdash; has a decidedly &lsquo;Seasons of Love&rsquo; quality.&rdquo; The New York Times &ldquo;Still waiting for wide recognition is the season&rsquo;s best musical, which almost no one saw. The Woman Upstairs&hellip;is the type of brilliant show that, on paper, seems ridiculous: the anti-romantic, barely plotted posturings of a music-hating physicist and the blind violinist who lives in the apartment below. How could such a show possibly work? In most writers&rsquo; hands, it couldn&rsquo;t. But the two writers hit upon the only way to make a story like this play: Set it against the ever-bustling backdrop of New York City.&rdquo; Talkin&rsquo; Broadway 2004-05 Season Wrap Up
